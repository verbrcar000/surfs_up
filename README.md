# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide weather analysis to an investor looking to invest in my surf and ice cream shop. For this challenge specifically, the investor, W. Avy, wanted temperature data from the months of June and December to determnine whether or not the shop will be sustainable year round. I retrieved all temperatures for the months of June and December and then produced summary statistics for this data, telling us about the minimum and maximum temperatures as well as the average temperature for each of these months.

## Results
- The first main takeway from this analysis is that temperatures did change between the months of June and December. As seen in the images below, June's average temperature was around 75 degrees while December's average temperature was closer to 71 degrees.
- It is important to recognize, however, that this change is not very signifcant. Even max temperatures only differed by 1 degree between the two months with June's high being 84 and December's being 83.
- The only notable difference lies in the standard deviations. December's standard deviation was around 3.75 while June's was only around 3.26. This means temperatures do vary quite a bit more than in June during the month of December. This can also be seen when we look at the fact that June's low was 64 degrees while December's low was only 56.
