# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide weather analysis to an investor looking to invest in my surf and ice cream shop. For this challenge specifically, the investor, W. Avy, wanted temperature data from the months of June and December to determnine whether or not the shop will be sustainable year round. I retrieved all temperatures for the months of June and December and then produced summary statistics for this data, telling us about the minimum and maximum temperatures as well as the average temperature for each of these months.
